# Final Project Template

KIEI-451 Winter 2021

GROUP MEMBERS: Santosh Ranganath & Blake Stevens

PROJECT IDEA: An app that allows golfers to notify beverage cart attendants that they'd like a beverage or a snack and then be placed in a queue. This would help the cart attendants better plan their routes around the golf course to maximize sales. There could also be a feature that allows certain users to jump ahead in the queue at additional cost/tip (either as a premium member or by paying slightly more per transaction).

Test: this line was added by Blake as a Collaborator testing out pushing from VS code
